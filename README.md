## üìÑ Development Process

This portfolio was developed using modern web development practices:

1. **Design-First Approach**: Created wireframes and mockups before development
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Built core functionality first, then enhanced with advanced features
3. **Performance Focus**: Optimized for speed and user experience from the ground up
4. **Stability Priority**: Chose consolidated codebase for reliable deployment and launch
5. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verified compatibility across major browsers

## üìä Technical Highlights

### Current Architecture
- **Consolidated Codebase**: Single HTML file with integrated JavaScript for stability
- **Comprehensive CSS**: Single stylesheet containing all styling (planned for future modularization)
- **Glassmorphism Effects**: Modern design with backdrop filters and transparency
- **Responsive Grid**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptable layouts
- **Performance Classes**: Optimized scroll states and animation triggers

### JavaScript Features
- **Video Manager**: Intelligent lazy-loading with intersection observers
- **Scroll Performance**: Velocity-based optimization for smooth UX
- **Navigation System**: Smooth anchor scrolling with mobile-friendly hamburger menu
- **Image Zoom**: Custom overlay system for enhanced media viewing

### Performance Optimizations
- **Progressive Loading**: Videos load metadata first, then full content
- **Intersection Observer**: Efficient viewport-based triggering
- **Debounced Scrolling**: Optimized scroll event handling
- **Integrated Loading**: Streamlined file structure for faster initial load

## üé® Design Philosophy

The portfolio embodies a **glassmorphism** aesthetic with:
