# Daniel Powers – Portfolio

Hi, I’m Daniel Powers, a Computer Science undergraduate at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU). I will graduate in Summer 2025 with minors in Engineering Technology and Audio Production.

What began as a love for software and problem-solving evolved into a passion for intelligent hardware-software systems. Through hands-on experience with platforms like Arduino and Siemens PLCs, I discovered how rewarding it is to build embedded systems that respond to the real world — systems that don’t just compute, but interact. That realization drove me to accelerate graduation and pursue embedded computing with clarity and urgency.

I’m preparing to begin an M.S. in Computer Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK). I aim to contribute to sustainable, human-centered technologies — from intelligent robotics to assistive devices. This portfolio showcases the work that shaped that path: from low-level motor control to lighting system diagnostics, from practical logic design to research-driven circuit optimization.
