# Daniel Powers â€“ Portfolio

Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Powers, a Computer Science undergraduate at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU). I will graduate in Summer 2025 with minors in Engineering Technology and Audio Production.

What began as a love for software and problem-solving evolved into a passion for intelligent hardware-software systems. Through hands-on experience with platforms like Arduino and Siemens PLCs, I discovered how rewarding it is to build embedded systems that respond to the real world â€” systems that donâ€™t just compute, but interact. That realization drove me to accelerate graduation and pursue embedded computing with clarity and urgency.

Iâ€™m preparing to begin an M.S. in Computer Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK). I aim to contribute to sustainable, human-centered technologies â€” from intelligent robotics to assistive devices. This portfolio showcases the work that shaped that path: from low-level motor control to lighting system diagnostics, from practical logic design to research-driven circuit optimization.
