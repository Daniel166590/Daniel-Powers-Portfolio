# Daniel Powers â€“ Portfolio

ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Powers â€” a Computer Science undergraduate at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), graduating Summer 2025 with a minor in Engineering Technology.

I'm passionate about applying the knowledge gained through my Computer Science Major towards embedded systems, robotics, and designing intelligent hardware-software systems that solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m currently applying to the MS in Computer Engineering program at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), with the goal of contributing to sustainable, human-centered technologies.
