# Daniel Powers â€“ Portfolio

Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Powers â€” a Computer Science undergraduate at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), graduating in Summer 2025 with a minor in Engineering Technology and Audio Production.

I'm passionate about applying the knowledge gained through my Computer Science Major to embedded systems, robotics, and designing intelligent hardware-software systems that solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m pursuing an MS in Computer Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), hoping to contribute to sustainable, human-centered technologies and further bridge my knowledge of hardware-software integration.

**LED Driver Cart**
- Designed and tested an active cooling system that **reduced LED array temperatures by over 50%**.
- Identified and resolved electrical faults, including surge current events, incorrect fuse ratings, and driver instability.
- Acquired practical experience in power electronics, thermal characterization, and hardware-level debugging.
- Created a modular schematic for a portable, multi-panel LED array with independent power channels.
- Documented research procedures, design revisions, and test results for lab continuity.

**241 Robot**
> Autonomous towing platform used to mobilize the LED Driver Cart during field testing.
- Sole maintainer and point of contact for a legacy autonomous robot system with a Python-based control codebase.
- Responsible for operating the robot during research trials and maintaining functional readiness across test cycles.
- Coordinated synchronized testing between the 241 Robot and the LED Driver Cart, ensuring consistent deployment conditions.
- Support lab members by providing system knowledge, troubleshooting expertise, and hands-on operational guidance.
