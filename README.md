# Daniel Powers â€“ Portfolio

Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Powers â€” a Computer Science undergraduate at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), graduating in Summer 2025 with a minor in Engineering Technology and Audio Production.

I'm passionate about applying the knowledge gained through my Computer Science Major to embedded systems, robotics, and designing intelligent hardware-software systems that solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m pursuing an MS in Computer Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), hoping to contribute to sustainable, human-centered technologies and further bridge my knowledge of hardware-software integration.
